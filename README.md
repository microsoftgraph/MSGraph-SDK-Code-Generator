# Getting started

This project uses git submodules to integrate upstream dependencies, specifically [Vipr][vipr-source-repo]. If you need an alternate branch to include special fixes you'll need to check that out manually within the submodule.

For the solution to open properly, ensure submodules are updated before opening it in Visual Studio. When initially cloning this repo, use `git clone --recursive` to update submodules at the same time. Later, run `git submodule update` to manually update submodules. If you don't use the `--recursive` switch when cloning, run `git submodule init` first to initialize the submodule.

Once setup is complete, you can work with the GraphODataTemplateWriter solution as usual. If you encounter problems, make sure NuGet packages and project references are all up-to-date.

For more information on submodules read [this chapter](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) from the Git book and search the Web.

## Using Typewriter

Typewriter is a new solution for generating code files using the GraphODataTemplateWriter and VIPR. It is an executable that is intended to simplify the generation of code files. Build the solution to find the typewriter executable in `\MSGraph-SDK-Code-Generator\src\Typewriter\bin\Release`. The typewriter run options are:

* **-l**, **-language**:  The target language for the generated code files. The values can be: `Java`, `ObjC`, `CSharp`, `PHP`, `Python`, `TypeScript`, or `GraphEndpointList`. The default value is `CSharp`. This is not applicable when only generating clean and annotated metadata as specified by the `-generationmode Metadata` option.
* **-m**, **-metadata**: The local file path or URL to the target input metadata. The default value is `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata`. This value is required.
* **-v**, **-verbosity**: The log verbosity level. The values can be: `Minimal`, `Info`, `Debug`, or `Trace`. The default value is `Minimal`.
* **-o**, **-output**: Specifies the path to the output folder. The default value is the directory that contains typewriter.exe. The structure and contents of the output directory will be different based on the `-generationmode` and `-language` options.
* **-d**, **-docs**: Specifies the path to the base endpoint directory in the [microsoft-graph-docs](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-docs) repo. For example, use `c:\microsoft-graph-docs\api-reference\v1.0\` for the v1.0 endpoint documentation. The documentation is parsed to provide documentation annotations to the metadata which is then used to add doc comments in the generated code files. This option is required when using `-generationmode` values of `Metadata`, `Full`, or `TransformWithDocs`.
* **-g**, **-generationmode**: Specifies the generation mode. The values can be: `Full`, `Metadata`, `Files`, `Transform` or `TransformWithDocs`. `Full` (default) generation mode produces the output code files by cleaning the input metadata, parsing the documentation, and adding annotations before generating the output files. `Metadata` generation mode produces an output metadata file by cleaning metadata, documentation parsing, and adding documentation annotations. `Files` generation mode produces code files from an input metadata and bypasses the cleaning, documentation parsing, and adding documentation annotations. `Transform` generation mode processes the metadata according to the XSLT provided with the -t option. `TransformWithDocs` generation mode processes the metadata according to the XSLT and adds documentation annotations. `Transform` and `TransformWithDocs` require the -t argument to specify the XSLT file.
* **-f**, **-outputMetadataFileName**: The base output metadata filename. Only applicable for `-generationmode Metadata`. The default value is `cleanMetadataWithDescriptions` which is used with the value of the `-endpointVersion` to generate a metadata file named `cleanMetadataWithDescriptionsv1.0.xml`.
* **-e**, **-endpointVersion**: The endpoint version used when naming a metadata file. Expected values are `v1.0` and `beta`. Only applicable for `-generationmode Metadata`.
* **-p**, **-properties**: Specify properties to support generation logic in the T4 templates. Properties must take the form of *key-string:value-string*. Multiple properties can be specified by setting a space in between property. The only property currently supported is the *php.namespace* property to specify the generated model file namespace. This property is optional.
* **-t**, **-transform**: Specify the URI to the XSLT that will preprocess the metadata. Only applicable for `-generationmode Transform` or `-generationmode TransformWitDocs`.

### Example typewriter usage

#### Transform metadata with XSLT.

The output `cleanMetadata.xml` will be located in the same directory as typewriter.exe.

`.\typewriter.exe -v Info -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-metadata/master/v1.0_metadata.xml -g Transform -t https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-metadata/master/transforms/csdl/preprocess_csdl.xsl`

#### Transform metadata with XSLT and add documentation annotations.

The output `cleanMetadataWithDescriptionsv1.0.xml` will be located in the same directory as typewriter.exe.

`.\typewriter.exe -v Info -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-metadata/master/v1.0_metadata.xml -g TransformWithDocs -t https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-metadata/master/transforms/csdl/preprocess_csdl.xsl -d D:\repos\microsoft-graph-docs`

#### Generate TypeScript typings from a CSDL (metadata) file without cleaning or annotating the CSDL.

The output will go in to the `outputTypeScript` directory.

`.\typewriter.exe -v Info -m D:\cleanMetadataWithDescriptions_v10.xml -o outputTypeScript -l TypeScript -g Files`

#### Clean and annotate a metadata file with documentation annotations sourced from the documentation repo

The output metadata file will go in to the `output2` directory. The output metadata file will be named `cleanMetadataWithDescriptionsv1.0.xml` based on the default values.

`.\typewriter.exe -v Info -m D:\v1.0_2018_10_23_source.xml -o output2 -d D:\repos\microsoft-graph-docs -g Metadata`

#### Generate C# code files from the metadata that will be cleaned and annotated with documentation annotations sourced from the documentation repo

The output C# code files will go in to the `output` directory.

`.\typewriter.exe -v Info -m D:\v1.0_2018_10_23_source.xml -o output -l CSharp -d D:\repos\microsoft-graph-docs -g Full`

## Use Typewriter to test your beta metadata

We assume that the metadata you are using is based off the beta metadata file.

1. Download the [latest Typewriter release](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/MSGraph-SDK-Code-Generator/releases).
2. Run Typewriter to generate a clean metadata file from your test metadata file. The output file will be `cleanMetadata.xml`.

`.\typewriter.exe -v Info -m <TODO-SET-PATH-TO-YOUR-METADATA> -g Transform -t https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-metadata/master/transforms/csdl/preprocess_csdl.xsl`

<!-- Excludes documentation which would make for an ugly diff. May need to add the doc step for diff purposes. -->

3. Generate .NET code files with Typewriter using the generated `cleanMetadata.xml`.

`.\typewriter.exe -v Info -m D:\cleanMetadata.xml -o outputDirectory -g Files`

4. Clone the Beta .NET SDK https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-beta-sdk-dotnet.
5. Replace the files under `src/Microsoft.Graph/Requests/Generated` and `src/Microsoft.Graph/Models/Generated` in the Beta .Net SDK with the generated files.
6. Build the Beta .Net SDK to validate that the generated files compile.

At this point you should have a valid SDK.

## Using Vipr with this Writer

1. Build the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Go to the `src\GraphODataTemplateWriter\bin\debug` folder to find all compiled components.
3. In that folder, modify `.config\TemplateWriterSettings.json` to specify your template mapping see [Template Writer Settings](##Template-Writer-Settings) for more details.
4. Open a command prompt as administrator in the same folder and run `Vipr.exe <path-or-url-to-metadata> --writer="GraphODataTemplateWriter"`.  An example metadata file can be found in the root of this project.

By default, output source code will be put in a folder named "output" next to the Vipr executable.

## Template Writer Settings
### Available Languages

There are five languages to choose from at the moment.  Java, ObjC, CSharp, TypeScript and Python.  Specify which language you want to generate in the `TargetLanguage` setting.

### Templates
You must specify a template directory under the `TemplatesDirectory` Settings.  The directory can be a full path or relative to the running directory.  The directory must contain a sub directory for each platform you want to generate code for. See the Templates directory for an example.

### Template Mapping
You must specify the mapping of T4 Templates to specific SubProcessors for each platform you wish to generate.  The `TemplateMapping` setting is a dictionary of languages and list of templates.  Each template must specify :

- `Template`, the name of the template without the extensions.
- `SubProcessor` The SubProcessor for the template see [SubProcessors](#SubProcessors)
- `Type` The type of template.
- `Name` The format string for the name.

and optionally :

- `Include`, a semicolon delimited list of objects to include in the subprocessor.
- `Exclude`, a semicolon delimited list of objects to exclude from the subprocessor.
- `Ignore`, a semicolon delimited list of objects to ignore from the subprocessor.
- `Matches`, a semicolon delimited list of objects to include in the subprocessor.
- `FileCasing`, `UpperCamel`, `LowerCamel` or `Snake` for the file casing for the specific file being created.

**Note: Many of these optional parameters were used before Vipr had full support for annotations; now that annotations have been added to Vipr usage of these parameters should be limited to legacy scenarios**

Example :

` { "Template": "EntityCollectionPage", "SubProcessor": "NavigationCollectionProperty", "Type": "Request", "Name": "<Class><Property>CollectionPage", "Matches" : "includeThisType", "Exclude" : "ExcludedTypeName;OtherExcludedTypeName" }`

It is important to understand that subprocessors are mapped to methods that query the **OdcmModel** and return a set of OData objects. This mapping is maintained in [TemplateProcess.InitializeSubprocessor()](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/MSGraph-SDK-Code-Generator/blob/dev/src/GraphODataTemplateWriter/TemplateProcessor/TemplateProcessor.cs#L54). The language specific mappings exist in the [config directory](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/MSGraph-SDK-Code-Generator/tree/dev/src/GraphODataTemplateWriter/.config). Each OData object returned by the subprocessor is applied to the mapped template which results in a code file output per each OData object.

In the above example, the objects in result set of the NavigationCollectionProperty subprocessor will each be applied to the EntityCollectionPage template. Each result will be a code file for each object returned by the NavigationCollectionProperty subprocessor.

#### SubProcessors

The SubProcessors determine what type of OData object will be passed into the template generating the code file.

- `CollectionMethod` All Methods that are of type Collections
- `CollectionProperty` Properties that are of type collection
- `CollectionReferenceProperty` All Navigation Properties that are of type Collection which are used in Non-Containment Collections
- `ComplexType` All Complex types
- `EntityContainer`  The EntityContainer
- `EntityReferenceType` All Entity types which are used in Non-Containment Collections
- `EntityType` All Entity types
- `EnumType` All Enumerable types
- `MediaEntityType` All Media Entity types
- `Method` All Actions and Functions
- `MethodWithBody` All Methods and Functions that send a body within the http request
- `NavigationCollectionProperty` All Navigation Properties that are of type Collection
- `NonCollectionMethod` All Methods and Functions that do not return a collection
- `Other` The entire model.
- `Property` All Properties types
- `StreamProperty` All Properties types that return a Streams

#### Types

The type of template.

- `Request` A template that will make a request
- `Model` A model
- `Shared` A template that will not output any code but is included by other templates
- `Client` The template used to create the Client object
- `Other` Any other type


#### Template Name

To set the name of the template using the `Name` format string. You can insert `<Class>`, `<Property>`, `<Method>`, and `<Container>` the values will be replaced by the names of the corresponding object.  If you insert an item that doesn't exist it will be replaced with an empty string.
Note: You can also set the template name from inside the template by : `host.SetTemplateName("foo");`

#### Template Editing

The solution contains a non-building project to host the actual T4 templates and make browsing/editing them easier.  New template files will be automatically discovered by this project.

#### Includes/Excludes

There may be specific times when you want to exclude or only process certain objects from the SubProcessor. To Do this you can either set a semicolon delimited list of objects you wanted to include : `Include : foo;bar`. This will only process objects whose names are foo or bar.  The opposite of this is the exclude setting where the SubProcessor will include all objects except for those whose names are in the exclude list, exclude and include can not be used together.

#### Ignore/Matches
When you can't use the name of an object to include or exclude you can use the long description element on any object.  Insert a long description with a semicolon delimited list of strings like : `foo;bar;baz`.  If you add a `"Matches" : "foo;baz"` only objects who contain foo and baz in their long description will be processed.  The opposite is true for Ignore.

Note: You can also check in a template by `odcjObject.LongDescriptionContains("foo");`

**Note: Includes/Excludes and Ignore/Matches were used before Vipr had full support for annotations; now that annotations have been added to Vipr usage of these parameters should be limited to legacy scenarios**

## Building against Graph Metadata

There are currently several steps we take to form the metadata into one that will successfully generate SDKs in the shape we expect:

  - Remove capability annotations (see [#132](https://github.com/Microsoft/Vipr/issues/132))
  - Add navigation annotation to thumbnail
     ```xml
     <Annotation String="navigable" Term="Org.OData.Core.V1.LongDescription"/>
     ```
  - Remove HasStream properties from ```onenotePage``` and ```onenoteEntityBaseModel```
  - Add ```ContainsTarget="true"``` to navigation properties that do not have a corresponding EntitySet. This currently applies to navigation properties that contain plannerBucket, plannerTask, plannerPlan, and plannerDelta.
  - Add long descriptions to types and properties from [docs](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/overview)

In order to build against metadata other than that stored in the [metadata](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/MSGraph-SDK-Code-Generator/tree/master/metadata) directory, you will need to perform the first four on this list.
